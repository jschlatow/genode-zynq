               Device drivers needed for scenarios
                 using the FPGA of the Zynq SoC
                     with a custom bitstream

The package requires three ROM sessions: A bitstream 'fpga.bit', a config
'fpga_devices' specifying the additional devices, and a config 'policy'
specifying the additional policy. The 'policy' ROM is merged with the default
config ROM of the internal platform driver. Similarly, the 'fpga_devices' ROM
is merged with the default devices ROM once the FPGA bitstream has been loaded.
In return, the package provides a Platform session.  Moreover, reporting of the
platform driver can be enabled via the 'policy' ROM.  The reports are routed to
the parent.
